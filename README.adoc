= Humongous allocator

This is a sample application that continuously creates humongous objects.
Its creates a few hundreds MB of short lived objects, and then a humongous object (a `long` array).

== Build

[source]
----
mvn compile
----

== Run

The `-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=8388608` parameter can be specified to tweak the humongous object size.
The app uses it even if a different GC than G1 is selected.
If not specified, `8388608` is used.
